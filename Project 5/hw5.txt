CHEMISTRY written as a tree:

             C
          /     \
      H            E
    /   \        /   \
   M     I      S     T
 /   \
R     Y

Where:
-C has children H and E
-H has children M and I
-E has children S and T
-M has children R and Y

In order for a minHeap to be valid, each non-leaf node in the tree must have a
lesser value than both of its children. 

Node with value C has lesser alphabetic value than children with value H and E.
Node with value H has lesser alphabetic value than children with value M and I.
Node with value E has lesser alphabetic value than children with value S and T.
Node with value M has lesser alphabetic value than children with value R and Y.

Thus the tree for CHEMISTRY is a valid minHeap.

Resulting tree after add(D) call:

Insert node D at last position.

            C
         /     \
      H          E
    /   \      /   \
  M       I   S     T
 / \     /
R   Y   D

As D has lesser value than I, swap the nodes.

            C
         /     \
      H          E
    /   \      /   \
  M       D   S     T
 / \     /
R   Y   I

As D has lesser value than H, swap the nodes.

            C
         /     \
      D          E
    /   \      /   \
  M       H   S     T
 / \     /
R   Y   I

MinHeap tree is now balanced.


4. 

Resulting tree after remove() call:

Swap top node with last node in the heap. 

            I
         /     \
      D          E
    /   \      /   \
  M       H   S     T
 / \     /
R   Y   C

Remove previous top node from the last position.

            I
         /     \
      D          E
    /   \      /   \
  M       H   S     T
 / \    
R   Y   

Swap new head node with its smallest child node.

            D
         /     \
      I          E
    /   \      /   \
  M       H   S     T
 / \     
R   Y   

Swap I node with its smallest child node.

            D
         /     \
      H          E
    /   \      /   \
  M       I   S     T
 / \    
R   Y  

MinHeap tree is now balanced.
