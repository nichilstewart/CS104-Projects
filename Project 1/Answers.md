	1. git add hw1q2b.cpp
	2. git log -p -3

	d) Git will prompt you for a message in order to commit the 3 files to 
	   the repo.

	e) git clone git@github.com:usc-csci104-fall2019/hw-nichilst.git


Problem 3:

	a) README.md is currently untracked

	b) README.md and fun_problem.txt are both currently untracked.

	c) README.md and fun_problem.txt are both currently staged for commit.

	d) README.md and fun_problem.txt are both currently modified.

	e) README.md is currently staged for commmit. fun_problem.txt has 
	   had its local changes discarded and is thus unmodified.

	Contents of fun_problem.txt are empty.

	f) All changes made up to 'git add README.md' are currently staged to commit. 

	   The change 'echo "Fancy git move" >> README.md' has not been staged to commit 
	   and is thus only modified.
